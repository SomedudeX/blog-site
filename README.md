## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal blog site found [here](https://codewithzichen.bine.me/). The website uses static website generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a slightly modified version of the [hugo blog awesome](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome) theme. 

New blogs are added as markdown files in `content/blog`, and static assets such as images and gifs are stored in `content/assets`.
